# nvda-mcp — Roadmap and Status Board

Companion to [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (operating manual) and [`specs/`](specs/)
(design specs). This document owns build order **and execution status**. It is
the answer to "what should we do now?" — and it lives in the repo, so a fresh
session or a new contributor answers that question without anyone's private
notes.

## How to use this board — **Decided**

- **Finding the next step:** take the first entry in a lane below that is not
  marked Done, respecting the lane rules. Its "Spec" field tells you what kind
  of work comes next:
  - **Spec: none yet** → the next step is a spec conversation, not code. Branch
    off main for the entry, write the spec there (`specs/NNNN-title.md`) with
    Marlon, and get it agreed in conversation. The spec **must include the
    class/file layout** — every class to be added, its role, and its
    collaborators — so the decomposition is reviewed before code (see AGENTS.md,
    "Spec before code"). The spec rides in the implementing PR on that branch —
    it does not land on main separately — and the PR updates the entry's Spec
    field. Never code ahead of an agreed spec: implementation starts on the
    branch only after the spec is approved in conversation.
  - **Spec: exists** → implement it in a PR judged against the spec (branch off
    main; short PR: one component + its port(s) + tests, per AGENTS.md).
- **Marking done:** the implementing PR flips its own entry to
  "Done (PR #n, date)" as part of the PR. The mark becomes true on main exactly
  when the PR merges — no separate bookkeeping commit.
- **Lanes:** lane 1 (bridge) and lane 2 (server) may run in parallel — at most
  one open PR per lane, never two in the same lane. Order within a lane is
  strict. (Entries 5 and 6 predate this rule and are grandfathered; from here
  on it holds.)
- **Manual live-NVDA checklists** and their results live in the implementing
  PR's body as checkboxes; findings are written inline on the unchecked item
  (NVDA version, expected vs observed) and spawn new iteration entries here.
  The `no unchecked checkboxes` CI job keeps an unfinished checklist from
  merging.
- **Grandfathering:** entries merged before this board existed are backfilled
  as Done with their historical PR numbers, with RFC 0001 as their spec.
  In-flight PRs at the time the board landed also run under RFC 0001; every
  entry after them gets its own spec file.

## Session map

The sessions come from
[RFC 0001](specs/0001-agent-driven-nvda-over-mcp.md), Milestones: **A**
foundation → **B** bridge core (headless) → **C** bridge↔NVDA (needs live
NVDA) → **D** MCP server (headless; parallel to B/C) → **E** introspection +
real-world → **F** packaging. Each board entry belongs to one session.
[Spec 0005](specs/0005-multi-reader-direction.md) (the multi-reader direction
RFC, agreed 2026-07-18) added one cross-cutting wire entry to lane 1 (entry 8,
a headless B follow-up) and amended the scope of entries 9 and 12.

Session E was originally one entry (11). It became four on 2026-07-23 — 11
(the real-world run), 11.1 (introspection), 11.2 (human-in-the-loop) and 11.3
(observe-only) — with the run deliberately first. See the note under
Convergence for why.

## Status board — lane 1: bridge

**Lane 1 is complete** as of 2026-07-22: every entry below is Done, milestones
A–C are closed, and no lane-1 work is in flight. The known future lane-1 entry
is Remote TCP, deferred under 9.1b with its own security spec; it is not
scheduled. Work now proceeds in lane 2.

1. **Done** — A, foundation: shared wire protocol + tests, server and addon
   scaffolds, CI, GPL-2.0-or-later licensing. Spec: RFC 0001. Merged as PR #1
   (2026-07-13).
2. **Done** — B, wire enumerations as real enums (`StrEnum` in `protocol.py`).
   Spec: RFC 0001. Merged as PR #3 (2026-07-15).
3. **Done** — B, hexagonal architecture agreed for bridge AND server (docs
   only; the rules now in AGENTS.md). Spec: RFC 0001 + AGENTS.md. Merged as
   PR #4 (2026-07-15).
4. **Done** — B, headless foundation + buffer entities; drops the NVDA source
   dependency (pyright ignore list for the NVDA edge). Spec: RFC 0001. Merged
   as PR #5 (2026-07-15).
5. **Done** — B, MessageChannel port + JSON-lines adapter: the Session's
   whole-message I/O seam, framing behind the Transport adapter seam. Spec:
   [0002-bridge-message-channel.md](specs/0002-bridge-message-channel.md)
   (retroactive, rides in the PR). Merged as PR #6 (2026-07-17).
6. **Done** — B, Transcript port + file transcript stack: the session's
   human-readable record, vocabulary tested against a fake writer, real IO in
   a decision-free leaf. Spec:
   [0003-bridge-transcript.md](specs/0003-bridge-transcript.md) (retroactive,
   rides in the PR). Merged as PR #7 (2026-07-17).
7. B, session controller — split into two sequential PRs, one spec:
   [0004-bridge-session-controller.md](specs/0004-bridge-session-controller.md)
   (rides in PR 7a's branch).
   - **7a** — **Done (PR #9, 2026-07-17)**: five domain ports (`AdapterFactory`
     — mode known only after `hello` — speech/braille sources, synth swapper,
     gesture sender), `Session` (handshake, dispatch, heartbeat + inactivity
     watchdogs, teardown that always restores the synth), the scriptable
     fakes, session unit tests.
   - **7b** — **Done (PR #10, 2026-07-18)**, closes session B: `echo` wire
     command + `EchoHandler`, `wiring.py` (`build_session`), `LoopbackTransport`,
     and the headless wire-level scenario — the integration surface lane 2
     tests against.
8. **Done (PR #11, 2026-07-18)** — B follow-up (headless; added by
   [spec 0005](specs/0005-multi-reader-direction.md)), wire: the published
   contract — `hello` announces `reader` (name + version) and `capabilities`
   (replacing `nvdaVersion`), a `COMMAND_SHAPES` table in `protocol.py`, a JSON
   Schema generated from the dataclasses (`specs/wire/v1/schema.json`) with a CI
   drift gate, and the hand-written prose semantics doc
   (`specs/wire/v1/protocol.md`). Spec:
   [0006-wire-published-contract.md](specs/0006-wire-published-contract.md)
   (rides in the PR).
9. **Done** — C, bridge↔NVDA: real NVDA adapters (`adapters/nvda_*.py`),
   `synthDrivers/nvdaMcpSpy.py`, the `socket_transport.py`/`tcp_listener.py`
   accept stack, plugin wiring, panic gesture, scons build. Real adapters supply
   the live `reader`/`capabilities` values for the `hello` fields entry 8 adds.
   The listener is a **start/stop lifecycle controller** (`BridgeServer`) with
   observable status (stopped / listening on endpoint / session active) — the
   seam entry 9.1's control dialog drives — not a fire-and-forget loop
   (agreed 2026-07-18). Spec:
   [0007-bridge-nvda-edge.md](specs/0007-bridge-nvda-edge.md) (agreed
   2026-07-19; delivered as three sequential PRs, the split agreed 2026-07-19
   to keep checklist iteration on a small final PR). Scope: RFC 0001
   milestones 1–3; the fail-safe synth restoration design (config name swap,
   `pre_configSave` guard, `getSynthInstance` patch) is **Decided** in RFC 0001.
   - **9a** — **Done (PR #12, 2026-07-20)**: the headless connection stack —
     `Listener` seam + `TcpListener`, `SocketTransport`, and `BridgeServer`,
     proven by a real-socket integration scenario in CI.
   - **9b** — **Done (PR #13, 2026-07-20)**: the NVDA adapters (`nvda_*.py`) +
     `nvdaMcpSpy` spy synth (addon still inert), the pure `spy_sink` seam
     unit-tested, and the announced capabilities narrowed to
     speech/braille/gestures.
   - **9c** — **Done (PR #14, 2026-07-21)**: the switch-on — `plugin.py`
     wiring, the panic gesture (`kb:NVDA+control+shift+b`), packaging verified,
     and the live-NVDA checklist run with Marlon at the keyboard (results in
     the PR body). Live testing **pivoted the silent-mode mechanism**: the spy
     synth + `SynthSwapper` + RFC 0001 fail-safe (9b) were replaced by
     transparent capture at `filter_speechSequence` (the real synth stays
     loaded; it cannot strand the user mute), and the PR added session beeps,
     the `announce` hint command, crashed-client resilience, and a build
     dependency fix. See [spec 0008](specs/0008-transparent-silent-capture.md).
9.1. C follow-up, bridge control UI + connection config (agreed 2026-07-18;
   split into 9.1a/9.1b 2026-07-21 — the transport leaf has no UI dependency,
   so it does not need to wait behind the dialog).
   - **9.1a** — **Done (PR #18, 2026-07-21)**: the named-pipe transport leaf (ctypes,
     stdlib-only) — `NamedPipeListener`/`NamedPipeTransport`, implementing the
     existing `Listener`/`Transport` seams exactly, so either can be handed to
     `BridgeServer` interchangeably with `TcpListener`/`SocketTransport`.
     Local-machine-only by construction (`PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS` + an
     owner-only DACL, the pipe analogue of the loopback-only bind). Proven by
     a real-named-pipe headless integration scenario in CI, the same tier of
     proof 9a gave the TCP leaf, **and then by a live-NVDA check against a
     real, running NVDA** (`test_live_nvda_pipe_e2e.py`: handshake, a
     silent-mode gesture captured, two sequential sessions) — on the strength
     of that result, `plugin.py` was flipped to the pipe as the default in
     this same PR (amendment to spec 0010), rather than waiting for 9.1b.
     `TcpListener` stays in the tree, unwired, as 9.1b's compat option.
     `DEFAULT_PIPE_NAME` added to the shared wire module; the wire spec's
     transport section (`specs/wire/v1/protocol.md` §1) amended to describe
     it. Spec: [0010-named-pipe-transport.md](specs/0010-named-pipe-transport.md).
   - **9.1b** — **Done (PRs #20, #21, #22, 2026-07-22)**: an NVDA menu → Tools
     entry opening a bridge dialog — connection-mode combo (Local: named pipe
     [default] / loopback TCP; Remote: TCP/IP, **greyed out** — see below),
     status indicator showing the accepting endpoint, Start/Stop buttons
     driving entry 9's lifecycle controller, and an auto-start checkbox — all
     persisted to NVDA config. The pipe is already the plugin's default
     (9.1a); this entry lets a user *override* it back to loopback TCP via
     config, rather than making the switch itself. **Remote TCP is deferred —
     Decided**: it is remote keystroke injection (`pressGesture`) and config
     write (`setConfig`), so enabling it is a future entry with its own
     security spec (explicit warning + bridge-generated access token presented
     in `hello`); until then the combo shows it disabled. Delivered as three
     sequential PRs: **#20** the domain foundation (`EventBus`, `Log`,
     `BridgeConfig` ports + the `BridgeEvent` DTO), **#21** the adapters and
     plugin wiring (`IniBridgeConfig`, the event bus, `BridgeServer` status
     events), **#22** the dialog itself (`views/bridge_dialog.py`, Tools menu
     registration) with the live-NVDA GUI checklist run against NVDA 2026.1.1
     (results in the PR body). Spec:
     [0011-bridge-control-ui.md](specs/0011-bridge-control-ui.md).
9.2. **Done (PR #17, 2026-07-21)** — C follow-up, NVDA log capture per
   session: every session tees NVDA's own log to a fresh, session-scoped file
   for `hello` to teardown, so debugging an add-on no longer needs manual
   before/after markers in `nvda.log`. `hello` gains an optional `logLevel` to temporarily
   raise NVDA's own logging verbosity for the session (restored at
   teardown), alongside the always-on capture. A second, parallel artifact
   to the existing transcript (spec 0003) — NVDA's real diagnostic log, not
   the bridge's domain vocabulary. Needs live NVDA (checklist: capture file
   distinct from `nvda.log`, `logLevel` surfaces DEBUG lines, level restored
   after teardown). Spec:
   [0009-nvda-log-capture.md](specs/0009-nvda-log-capture.md) (agreed
   2026-07-21).

## Status board — lane 2: server (headless; may run parallel to lane 1)

**Lane 2's only entry is complete** as of 2026-07-23: session D is closed, and
with lane 1 already complete, convergence is unblocked. The next step is
**entry 11a** (expose `announce`), then **11b** (the real-world run) — see the
resequencing note under Convergence below.

10. **Done (PRs #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38,
    2026-07-23)** — D, MCP server — **in Go**, a statically linked binary
    speaking MCP over stdio and JSON lines to one bridge. Spec:
    [0013-mcp-server.md](specs/0013-mcp-server.md) (agreed 2026-07-22; rides in
    10a's branch). Scope: RFC 0001 component 2 + milestone 4, encoding the
    reader-agnostic chassis principles of
    [spec 0005](specs/0005-multi-reader-direction.md) (no reader conditionals;
    reader identity surfaced; reader vocabulary as opaque data; bridge endpoint
    as composition-root config). The language change **amends 0005's "the v1
    server is Python"**, and the entry's original "`BridgeClient` port" wording
    is amended to seven capability-group ports — both recorded in spec 0013,
    both landing in 10a. Dialing **both** the pipe and loopback TCP is in scope
    from the start (amended 2026-07-22, superseding the earlier "small lane-2
    follow-up" note), and 0013 goes further: each reader declares every endpoint
    its bridge is known to listen on, tried in order, so spec 0011's transport
    toggle needs no configuration. Delivered as three sequential PRs:
    - **10a** — **Done (PRs #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, 2026-07-22)**: the module,
      the generated wire binding, the layered endpoint
      config, and the bridge client: dials a bridge and completes a handshake,
      proven headlessly. No MCP surface. Carries spec 0013 and the 0005 and
      AGENTS.md amendments; deletes the Python `mcpServer/` scaffold and turns
      the CI `server` job into a Go one (job name unchanged — branch protection
      matches literal names). **Delivered as five sequential PRs** (the short-PR
      principle applied to a 6,000-line first cut): the wire binding and the Go
      CI job; the `mcpServer/` deletion; the domain; the bridge client;
      discovery, config, wiring and the entry point. The deletion waits for the
      first, because the `server` job must be repointed at Go before the
      directory it names disappears.
    - **10b** — **Done (PRs #34, #35, #36, 2026-07-23)**: the MCP surface:
      `list_readers` / `connect_reader` /
      `disconnect_reader` / `status`, the capability-gated tool set, the
      `screenreader://info` resource, and the agent-initiated connection
      lifecycle (no auto-connect, no backoff). Amends the wire prose with the
      pipe naming convention.
    - **10c** — **Done (PRs #37, #38, 2026-07-23)**: the cross-language
      conformance job (`windows-latest`, the real Python bridge over a real pipe
      and over TCP), release plumbing for the `server-v*` tag, and the board
      flip. The conformance tier is the successor to the same-bytes drift
      guarantee the two halves had while both were Python: it is the only place
      where both implementations of `specs/wire/v1/` are real, so a bug in the
      generated binding — invisible to every tier whose bridge is a Go fake
      encoding with that same binding — has somewhere to surface. It found one
      on its first run (the named-pipe leaf reporting an idle read as a lost
      connection, so every command slower than one 50 ms poll failed over the
      transport the add-on ships listening on). The `conformance` job is a new
      job name, so it became a **required status check only after it had
      reported green on main** (2026-07-23) — branch protection matches required
      checks by literal name, so pushing the workflow and flipping the setting
      are deliberately two steps, in that order.

## Convergence (requires C and D both Done)

**Entry 11 was resequenced on 2026-07-23** (agreed in conversation). It
originally read "introspection + real-world" as one entry. It is now **four**,
because a discovery pass found that the two halves have almost nothing to do
with each other and that the real-world run is not blocked on anything:

- The server side of introspection is **already complete**. `FocusInfo()`,
  `State()`, `GetConfig()` and `SetConfig()` exist on `JSONLinesClient`, the
  four tools exist, and the capability gate covers them — all merged in 10b.
  The entire remaining gap is bridge-side: `NVDA_CAPABILITIES` in
  `domain/controllers/commands/registry.py` announces only
  speech/braille/gestures/announce, and the four commands answer
  `NotImplementedHandler`. So introspection is a **lane-1-only** entry.
- The real-world run therefore needs **nothing new**: the gate derives the
  advertised tool set from what `hello` announced, so an agent connecting today
  sees the four ungated tools, the five speech tools, `getBraille` and
  `pressGesture` — press a gesture, read what was said, which is the core loop
  the run exists to exercise. Running it first means the findings shape the
  entries after it instead of being guessed at.

**The run is `live` mode, attended — Decided (2026-07-23).** This is what makes
the ordering work. In `silent` mode all of NVDA's speech is suppressed, so an
agent that announces "I am stuck" tells the tester something they then cannot
act on: they cannot hear their way to the chat window to reply, and their only
escape is the panic gesture, which stops the whole bridge. In `live` mode the
real synth keeps talking, so the tester hears the app, hears themselves reach
the agent's window, and answers there normally. Silent + unattended is exactly
the configuration that needs entry 11.2, which is why 11.2 comes after the run
rather than before it.

11. **E, the real-world run** — split into two sequential PRs, one spec:
    [0014-announce-and-real-world-run.md](specs/0014-announce-and-real-world-run.md)
    (**drafted 2026-07-23, awaiting review**; rides in 11a's branch). Scope:
    RFC 0001 milestone 6.
    - **11a** — **Done (PR #39, 2026-07-24)**: expose `announce` at the MCP
      server. The bridge half has shipped
      since 9c (spec 0008): `NvdaAnnouncer` speaks straight through
      `getSynth().speak()`, which bypasses the suppression filter, so a hint is
      audible even mid-silence, and the bridge already advertises
      `Capability.ANNOUNCE`. The server simply never exposed it — there is no
      `announce` tool and no `CapabilityAnnounce` in the domain vocabulary, so
      the one channel the agent has for reaching a human is unreachable. Five
      files: a domain port, a `JSONLinesClient` method, the domain capability
      constant plus its handshake mapping, the tool, and a registry line.
      `CommandAnnounce`, `CapabilityAnnounce` and `AnnounceParams` already exist
      in the generated binding, so the wire needs no change.
    - **11b** — the end-to-end run against
      [EnhancedFindDialog](../EnhancedFindDialog) with Claude Code as the MCP
      client, `live` mode, tester at the keyboard. The live-NVDA checks here are
      what prove each real adapter behaves like its fake. **Findings are the
      deliverable**: they spawn iteration entries (E.1, E.2, …) in this board,
      per the checklist rule above.
      - **E.1 — `pressGesture` never reached NVDA: the `kb:` prefix was fed to
        `fromName`.** Found in the 11b run (NVDA 2026.1.1, Claude Code driving)
        when every agent-sent gesture was refused — `kb:windows+d` and
        `kb:control+l` both came back `unknown gesture id '…': 'kb:…'`. Root
        cause: `NvdaGestureSender.press` passed the wire's opaque inputCore id
        (`kb:control+l`) straight to `KeyboardInputGesture.fromName`, which wants
        the **bare** combo (`control+l`) — it splits on `+` and looks each token
        up in `vkCodes`, so `kb:control` raised `KeyError`. Every `pressGesture`
        failed identically; the `capture` scenario only ever "passed" on the
        tester's **physical** keypresses, not the agent's. Fix: a pure
        `bare_key_name` helper strips the `kb:`/`kb(layout):` source prefix,
        headless-tested in `tests/unit/adapters/`; the NVDA-touching sender is
        one line thinner. **Fixed in PR #41 and verified live 2026-07-25** —
        after the rebuild, agent-driven gestures drove the desktop end to end
        (spec 0018 Part A).
      - **E.2 — the gesture vocabulary is the reader's user-facing command
        notation, not an internal id. Done (PR #41).** E.1's tolerated `kb:` is
        NVDA inputCore's internal source-namespace, which no agent learns from
        user-facing docs; a source-privileged session reached for it and hit the
        bug, whereas an agent reading only the NVDA User Guide would have sent the
        prefixless `NVDA+f7` and worked even pre-E.1. So the canonical vocabulary
        is the User-Guide key-combo form (`NVDA+f7`, `control+l`, `escape`),
        prefixless; the server routes it opaquely, the bridge maps it via
        `fromName`, and a source prefix is reserved for future non-keyboard
        vocabularies. Reworded `protocol.md` and the `press_gesture` tool
        description; the bridge still tolerates a legacy `kb:`. Validated live in
        both `live` and `silent` mode. Spec:
        [0018-input-vocabulary.md](specs/0018-input-vocabulary.md), Part A.
      - **E.3 — a `type` primitive for literal text. Done (PR #42), verified live
        2026-07-25.** (lane 1 + lane 2). Gestures are commands; typing a URL or
        phrase is content and needs its own command, not one `pressGesture` per
        character (fragile: `VkKeyScanEx` fails for off-layout characters). A new
        `typeText` command + `typing` capability, injected via Win32 `SendInput`
        with `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE`, gated like `pressGesture`; withholding it under
        observe-only still rides on 0017, a separate entry (11.3) not yet built —
        only the `mutates_reader` classification it needs landed here. Live
        end-to-end against a real NVDA and Chrome: `type_text
        "www.blindtec.com.br"` landed all 19 characters (echoed back
        individually by NVDA's own "speak typed characters", proving the
        injection is indistinguishable from a real keystroke), the page loaded,
        and its Elements List was read back through `press_gesture`/`get_speech`.
        Spec: [0019-type-primitive.md](specs/0019-type-primitive.md).
        **Prioritised in lane 1** so the live tests can enter text — URLs, search
        phrases — instead of spelling them one gesture at a time.
11.1. **Done (PR #43, 2026-07-29)** — E, bridge introspection (lane 1). The four handlers behind
    `getFocusInfo` / `getState` / `getConfig` / `setConfig`, their ports and
    NVDA adapters, and re-widening `NVDA_CAPABILITIES` to announce `focus`,
    `state` and `config` — at which point the server's four already-built tools
    light up with no server change at all. Needs live NVDA. Spec:
    `0015-bridge-introspection.md` (agreed 2026-07-25; rode in 11.1's branch).
    Scope: RFC 0001 milestone 5. `setConfig` was amended twice during review and
    ended up never writing to the reader's config at all: a session override map
    with hooks on **both** ends of `AggregatedSection`, because hooking reads
    alone let NVDA's own settings dialog launder an override into the user's
    profile and persist it. Live-verified on a real NVDA, including the override
    beating both a manually activated and a trigger-driven profile switch — the
    claims `test_profile_override.py` was meant to cover and never has, since it
    needs NVDA's own interpreter and cannot run under pytest.
11.2. **E, human-in-the-loop** (both lanes). **Done** (#45). The agent asks the
    tester for something it cannot supply itself — a password, a CAPTCHA, a
    physical act — and gets an answer back, without ending the session. Live
    checklist in the PR body. Spec: `0016-human-in-the-loop.md` (agreed
    2026-07-29; implemented with the heartbeat fix on `0016-human-in-the-loop`).
    It was
    scheduled **after** the run so the run could say whether the cheap shape
    (announce, suspend suppression, acknowledgement gesture) suffices before a
    reply dialog is built: it ran, it does, and stage 2 stays unbuilt. The 11.1
    run also produced the evidence for the timeout analysis — sessions were
    silently torn down by the 120 s inactivity watchdog while a tester worked in
    NVDA's dialogs, discarding overrides mid-test.
11.3. **E, enforced observe-only** (both lanes). A session where the bridge
    *rejects* `pressGesture` and `setConfig`, so the tester drives and the agent
    can only watch. Orthogonal to capture mode — capture mode is about audio,
    this is about input — so it is a `control` field on `hello`, not a third
    `CaptureMode`. Spec: `0017-observe-only-control.md` (drafted, awaiting
    review; rides in 11.3's own PR).
11.4. **E, log slices on demand** (both lanes). **Next.** The agent asks what NVDA
    logged *while a given command ran*, filtered by level and by pattern and
    projected to the fields it needs, instead of being handed a path and reading
    the whole file. Finishes what 0009 started: that entry narrowed the haystack
    to one session, this narrows it to one command — and **supersedes that spec's
    capture file**, since the level raise is global, so NVDA's own `nvda.log`
    already holds identical records. Motivated by measurement during the 11.2
    review: the bridge answers in 0.2-0.5 ms, so the transport was never the cost;
    the cost was moving tens of thousands of tokens of log into context to find
    four lines. Needs live NVDA. Spec: `0020-log-slices-on-demand.md` (agreed
    2026-07-30; rides in 11.4's own PR).
    **Taken before 11.3** deliberately: it pays for itself in every later live
    session, 11.3's own included, and 11.3's spec is still awaiting review.
11.5. **E, observing the log** (both lanes). The agent marks the present moment,
    then asks what has arrived *since it last looked* — instead of only being able
    to ask what a given command logged. Comes straight out of 11.4's live run,
    which found two things its model cannot serve. A command window closes when the
    handler returns, but NVDA does the work a millisecond later on its own thread,
    so one window holds `inputCore.executeGesture` and little else; and the cases
    that matter most have **no commands at all** — a trigger whose consequences
    arrive over the next fifteen seconds, or "watch what I do, a bug is about to
    appear", where the human is driving and nothing the agent issues is what gets
    logged. Adds a mark (`getLogPosition`), a caller-held cursor
    (`sincePosition`/`nextPosition`), `lastSeconds` for "it just happened", and
    `waitForLog` — the `waitForSpeech` shape, so it stays pull rather than the push
    0020 rejected. Also extends a command's span to the *next* command, which is
    what makes a single window mean something again and retires 11.4's
    `capturedAtLevel` compromise. Needs live NVDA. Spec:
    `0021-observing-the-log.md` (drafted 2026-07-30, awaiting review).
12. F, packaging/release — split into two entries (agreed 2026-07-22), because
    the bridge's release path is decidable now while the server's distribution
    still has open questions from [spec 0005](specs/0005-multi-reader-direction.md).
    Spec: [0012](specs/0012-packaging-and-release.md) (12a).
    - **12a** — **Done (PR #25, 2026-07-22)**: the per-component tagging scheme
      shared by every component (`<component>-v<semver>`, version read from the
      component's own manifest and verified against the tag), plus the bridge's
      release workflow (tag `nvda-bridge-v*` → draft GitHub release carrying the
      `.nvda-addon`), the path-filtered PR add-on build, and the PR comment
      linking it. `ci.yml`'s gate jobs stay unconditional and unchanged.
    - **12b** — server distribution. Spec: none yet → specify when reached.
      Scope sketch: RFC 0001 milestone 7, plus what is left of spec 0005's
      decision list: umbrella Windows installer vs per-channel-only distribution
      (NVDA add-on store stays canonical for the add-on), an `.mcpb` bundle for
      Claude Desktop users, and targets beyond Windows amd64. The
      **implementation language is no longer open** — spec 0013 decided Go at
      session D and PyInstaller is off the table — and entry 10c already delivered
      the `server-v*` release path 12a reserved the namespace for: a tag builds
      the binary, runs it to check its version against the tag, and publishes a
      draft release.

## Out-of-band work (not board entries)

Changes that no entry called for, recorded so the board is not silently
incomplete:

- **PR #44, 2026-07-29** — one definition of "green". `uv run poe ci` runs
  everything CI runs, in CI's order, from the repo root; `uv run poe doctor`
  checks the machine can work the repo and **gates every other task**, because a
  broken toolchain makes passing and failing tests equally uninformative. Also
  quarantined the live-NVDA tests behind `poe live`: they drive the developer's
  real screen reader, were harmless only by accident (they skip when nothing is
  listening), and took over a blind maintainer's machine mid-task twice before
  being marked `live_nvda` and excluded by default.

- **2026-07-31** — the lint gate, and CI actually calling it. Ruff's rule set is
  now **chosen** in all three configs rather than inherited from whatever
  version is installed; the whole tree (179 files) was brought under it; and
  `ruff format --check` — the half that catches indentation, and the half that
  was missing — runs in `ci`. That gap is why PR #46 could add a dozen
  space-indented files to a tab repo without a single gate objecting, and the
  dev scripts turned out to be linted by *nothing*, falling between `shared/`
  and `bridges/nvda/`.

  The same PR made `.github/workflows/ci.yml` stop duplicating commands: each
  job now installs a toolchain and calls one task (`poe ci-shared`, `ci-server`,
  `ci-bridge`, `ci-conformance`). Two hand-maintained definitions of "green" had
  drifted in both directions — `poe ci` ran a lint task the workflow did not,
  while **staticcheck and the Linux build existed only in the workflow**, so no
  developer could run them. What made the unification possible was splitting
  `poe dev` (asks whether *this workstation* is fit: Go, ripgrep, intact venvs,
  a fresh server binary) from `poe ci` (does not, because a runner is rebuilt
  from the workflow every time and cannot have drifted). Those machine checks
  were the blocker: the `shared` job installs uv and nothing else, so the
  required `go` and `rg` aborted it before a single test ran.

## Principles — **Decided**

- PRs are short: one component + its port(s) + unit tests; nothing lands
  untested. Session B's split into PRs #3–#7 is the template — a "session" is
  a context boundary, not a PR size.
- Spec before code: every entry not grandfathered above is implemented against
  a spec agreed in conversation before any implementation is written, and the
  spec includes the class/file layout (roles + collaborators) so the
  decomposition is caught in review, not after code. The spec file rides in the
  implementing PR's branch and merges with it. If implementation forces a spec
  amendment, the amendment rides in the same PR.
- Items marked **Decided** here, in AGENTS.md, or in a spec's agreed sections
  are settled. Do not relitigate them silently; to change one, propose it
  explicitly and update the doc in the same PR that implements the change.
