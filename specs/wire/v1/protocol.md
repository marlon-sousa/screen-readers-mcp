# nvda-mcp wire protocol — v1

The published contract between an **MCP server** and a **screen-reader bridge**.
This is the human half of the contract; [`schema.json`](schema.json) beside it is
the machine half, generated from the reference Python implementation
(`shared/nvda_mcp_wire/protocol.py`) so shapes and prose cannot disagree.

A bridge author in any language implements this document plus the schema. The
NVDA bridge (`bridges/nvda/`) is the reference implementation; JAWS and TalkBack
bridges are anticipated (see
[spec 0005](../../0005-multi-reader-direction.md)) and would speak this same
contract with reader-specific values.

`protocolVersion` for this document is **1**. It is a pre-release version with no
external consumers yet, so it may still be amended in place; once a non-Python
bridge depends on it, changes go through a version bump.

## 1. Transport and framing

- The bridge **listens**; the server **dials**. The connection is always
  local-machine-only — never a routable interface. (An Android TalkBack
  bridge is the anticipated exception, reached over an `adb`-forwarded or
  Wi-Fi socket; it is still the listener.) A Windows bridge may offer either
  (or both, config-selectable) of:
  - a **TCP socket** bound to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) only. Default port:
    **8765** (`DEFAULT_PORT`).
  - a **Windows named pipe** (spec 0010), rejecting remote clients
    (`PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS`) and restricted by DACL to the owning
    user — the pipe analogue of the loopback-only bind. Default name:
    `\\.\pipe\nvdaMcpBridge` (`DEFAULT_PIPE_NAME`).
  Either way the framing and every command below are identical: the choice of
  transport is a connection-establishment detail, invisible once `hello` has
  completed.
- **Pipe naming convention.** A bridge offering a named pipe SHOULD name it
  `<reader>McpBridge`, where `<reader>` is the same value the bridge sends as
  `hello`'s `reader.name`. The convention exists so that a server can ship a
  sane default endpoint for a reader, and a user can predict the name when
  configuring one by hand. It is a naming rule only: it confers no trust, a
  server never infers an endpoint from the namespace, and `hello` remains the
  sole authority on which reader actually answered. The NVDA bridge already
  satisfies it (`\\.\pipe\nvdaMcpBridge`, `reader.name = "nvda"`).
- Framing is **JSON Lines**: each message is one JSON **object**, UTF-8 encoded,
  serialized without embedded newlines, terminated by a single `\n`. A reader
  reassembles chunks into newline-delimited frames and must drain any complete
  buffered lines before polling the socket again, so a message that already
  arrived is never lost to a later idle timeout.
- One object per line. A line that is not a JSON object (a JSON array, scalar,
  or malformed text) is a protocol fault — see §2.

## 2. Envelope

Two frame types cross the wire.

A **request** (server → bridge):

- `id` (int, required) — correlation id chosen by the server; the matching
  response echoes it.
- `cmd` (string, required) — the command name (§5). An unknown name is **not** a
  framing fault: the bridge replies with an error response and the session
  continues.
- `params` (object, optional) — command parameters; defaults to `{}`.

A **response** (bridge → server):

- `id` (int, required) — the request's id.
- Exactly **one** of:
  - `result` — the command's result payload (shape per §5), or
  - `error` — an object `{ "message": string }`.

Fault handling, all of which keep the session alive once established (§3):

- Unknown `cmd` → error response.
- A malformed line, a non-object line, or params that fail validation → error
  response (the reference implementation raises `ValidationError`, reported as an
  error message).
- Extra, unrecognized object fields are **ignored**, so a newer peer may add
  fields without breaking an older one.

## 3. Handshake and session lifecycle

1. The server sends `hello` **first**. It is the only command accepted before the
   handshake completes; any other command pre-handshake ends the connection.
2. `hello` params carry the server's `protocolVersion` and the requested capture
   `mode` (§4). The bridge requires `protocolVersion` to **equal** its own; a
   mismatch fails the handshake with an error response and the session ends.
   An optional `logLevel` (one of `debug`, `io`, `debugwarning`, `info` —
   NVDA's own valid logging levels) temporarily raises the reader's log
   verbosity for the session; omitted or absent leaves it unchanged. **This is
   a real, if temporary, change to the reader's own diagnostic logging, not a
   filter private to the capture file** — a logger only hands a record to any
   handler once it has decided to emit the record at all, so a bumped level
   is visible in the reader's own log too, for the session's duration. It is
   always restored at teardown, on every exit path.
3. On success the bridge replies with `HelloResult`:
   - `protocolVersion` (int) — the bridge's version.
   - `reader` (object `{ name, version }`) — **which** screen reader answered
     (§6). The NVDA bridge sends `name = "nvda"`.
   - `capabilities` (array of strings) — what this bridge supports (§4).
   - `mode` — the capture mode now in effect.
   - `synth` — the name of the reader's current speech synthesizer.
   - `logPath` — absolute path to this session's human-readable transcript
     (the bridge's own record of session events — gestures, speech, open/close).
4. After a successful handshake the session is **tolerant**: a failing command
   yields an error response and the session keeps running. Only the conditions in
   §6 (teardown) end it.

## 4. Capture modes and capabilities

**Capture mode** is chosen once, at `hello`, and fixes how speech is captured for
the whole session:

- `silent` — the reader's speech is intercepted *before* it reaches the
  synthesizer and captured there, so the user hears nothing. The real synth stays
  loaded and active throughout: nothing is swapped, renamed or terminated, so the
  reader and every add-on running inside it continue to see their configured
  synth, valid and in use. The bridge **must** lift the interception on every
  teardown path (§6). (The NVDA bridge does this at
  `speech.extensions.filter_speechSequence`; see spec 0008, which replaced an
  earlier design that swapped in a bundled spy synthesizer.)
- `live` — the real synth keeps speaking; speech is captured by observation.
  Ordering/timing is best-effort rather than exact.

A bridge may still offer a human-facing channel that is audible in `silent`
mode — see the `announce` capability below. It bypasses the interception rather
than defeating it: the point of `silent` is that the *reader's* output is
captured, not that the machine is mute.

**Capabilities** announce which command groups this bridge can serve. Each value
names one group:

| Capability | Commands it covers |
|---|---|
| `speech` | `getSpeech`, `getLastSpeech`, `getNextSpeechIndex`, `waitForSpeech`, `waitForSpeechToFinish` |
| `braille` | `getBraille` |
| `gestures` | `pressGesture` |
| `typing` | `typeText` |
| `focus` | `getFocusInfo` |
| `state` | `getState` |
| `config` | `getConfig`, `setConfig` |
| `interact` | `announce`, `askUser`, `waitForUserReply` |
| `log` | `getLog`, `setLogLevel` |

Rules:

- A consumer **must ignore an unknown capability string**, so the set can grow
  without breaking older peers. (This is the one forward-compatibility carve-out
  beyond "ignore unknown fields".)
- A command whose group is **not** in the announced set may be rejected with a
  normal error response. The NVDA bridge announces `speech`, `braille`,
  `gestures`, `typing` and `announce` today; `focus`, `state` and `config` are
  defined by this contract and served by no bridge yet, so it does not announce
  them.
- `hello`, `ping`, `echo`, and `bye` are lifecycle/diagnostic commands and belong
  to no capability group; they are always available once the session permits them
  (§3).

## 5. Commands

Every command's `params` and `result` shapes are defined in
[`schema.json`](schema.json) under `commands.<name>`. A `null` `params` there
means the command takes no parameters. Summary:

- `hello` — handshake (§3).
- `ping` → `{ ok: true }` — liveness only; see §6.
- `echo` `{ payload }` → `{ payload }` — returns the payload unchanged, for any
  JSON value; a whole-stack round-trip check.
- `pressGesture` `{ gestures: [string] }` → `{ ok: true }` — press the given
  reader gesture ids in order, blocking until each is processed. Gesture id
  syntax is **reader-specific** and passes through opaquely: it is the reader's
  own **user-facing command notation**, as its documentation writes it — for
  NVDA, the key-combo form from the User Guide (`"NVDA+f7"`, `"control+l"`,
  `"escape"`), not an internal identifier. The reader-specific bridge maps it to
  a keypress; an NVDA bridge tolerates a legacy `"kb:"` inputCore prefix but the
  documented form is prefixless.
- `typeText` `{ text }` → `{ ok: true }` — insert literal text at whatever
  currently holds system focus, layout-independent Unicode injection rather
  than a sequence of key commands. `text` is opaque content, routed without
  interpretation exactly as a gesture id is; it does **not** interpret control
  characters, newlines or Enter, and does not submit anything — compose that
  from `typeText` and `pressGesture`. Mutates the reader's machine the same way
  `pressGesture` does.
- `getSpeech` `{ sinceIndex }` → `{ text, fromIndex, toIndex }` — captured speech
  since an index (§7).
- `getLastSpeech` → `{ text, index }`.
- `getNextSpeechIndex` → `{ index }` — the index the next captured speech will
  occupy.
- `waitForSpeech` `{ text, afterIndex?, timeout? }` → `{ found, index, text }`.
- `waitForSpeechToFinish` `{ timeout? }` → `{ finished }`.
- `getBraille` `{ sinceIndex }` → `{ text, fromIndex, toIndex }`.
- `getFocusInfo` → `{ name, role, states, value, appModule }` — the focus
  object. `role`/`states` strings are reader-specific and pass through opaquely.
- `getState` → `{ browseMode, speechMode, sleepMode, inputHelp }` — queryable
  state that a reader may signal by sound rather than words; diff two snapshots
  across a gesture to assert a toggle. Values are reader-specific.
- `getConfig` `{ keyPath: [string] }` → `{ value }` — read a reader config value;
  `keyPath` is an opaque path into the reader's config tree.
- `setConfig` `{ keyPath: [string], value }` → `{ value }` — write one.
- `announce` `{ text }` → `{ ok: true }` — speak `text` to the **human** at the
  reader. A bridge→human hint channel, not agent-facing data: it is audible even
  in `silent` mode (§4), which is its whole purpose, because that is the mode in
  which the person can otherwise hear nothing. The bridge acknowledges that it
  spoke, never that anyone listened. There is no reply channel in v1.
- `bye` → `{ ok: true }` — the server asks to end the session (§6).
- `getLog` `{ commandId?, windows?, minLevel?, contains?, exclude?, fields?,
  maxEntries? }` → `{ text, entries, matched, truncated, fromCommandId,
  toCommandId, capturedAtLevel }` — return a filtered, formatted slice of the
  reader's diagnostic log for one or more command windows (spec 0020). Anchored by
  request id (defaults to the most recently marked command); `windows` counts back
  from the anchor. Filters compose: `minLevel` drops records below a level,
  `contains` keeps only matching messages, `exclude` drops matching modules or
  messages, all case-insensitive. `fields` projects which columns to render
  (default: time, level, module, message); an unknown field name or level is
  **rejected**, never silently dropped, so a typo cannot return a slice that
  merely looks filtered. `windows` > 1 returns one continuous span, from the
  first window's start to the last one's end, **including what fell between the
  windows** — a window closes when the handler returns, but the reader does the
  work the command caused just after that, so the record an agent wants is
  often a millisecond past the end mark. Ask for a single window when you want
  only that command; widen it to see what the command actually caused.
  Bounded by `maxEntries` (default 200);
  reports `matched` (before the cap), `truncated` (when capped or the window aged
  out of the ring), and `capturedAtLevel` (the floor in force while the window
  was recorded — an empty slice at `capturedAtLevel: "info"` with
  `minLevel: "debug"` means the records were never emitted, not that none exist).
  Over several windows `capturedAtLevel` reports the **oldest** window's floor, so
  it never claims to have captured more than the earliest part of the range did.
  Every marked command has a window, including one that **failed** — "show me the
  log for the command that just errored" is the case this exists for.
- `setLogLevel` `{ level }` → `{ level, previous }` — raise or lower the
  reader's diagnostic logging floor for the rest of the session. Forwards only:
  Python's logging decides at the *logger* whether a record exists, so a level
  that was never emitted cannot be recovered. Downwards is free. This is a real
  (if temporary) change to the reader; the level is restored at teardown on every
  exit path (spec 0020, superseding 0009's hello-only level change).
  Only `debug`, `io`, `debugwarning` and `info` may be **set** — the same four
  `hello`'s `logLevel` accepts. `warning` and `error` exist in `LogLevel` as
  `getLog` `minLevel` filters, where they are the common case; setting the
  reader's own floor to either would silence warnings in the **user's** nvda.log
  for the rest of the session, so both commands reject them.

Reader-specific vocabulary — gesture ids, roles, states, config key paths, state
values — is **opaque payload**: the server routes it without interpreting it, and
only the agent (which knows the reader) and the bridge understand it.

## 6. Liveness and teardown

The bridge runs two independent watchdogs while a session is established:

- **Heartbeat** — proves the server process is alive. Any message resets it,
  including `ping`.
- **Command inactivity** — proves the agent is still working. Only a real command
  resets it; `ping` deliberately does **not**, so a keepalive cannot mask an
  abandoned session.

A session ends on any of: `bye`, the peer closing the connection (EOF), either
watchdog firing, or an out-of-order pre-handshake command (§3).

On **every** teardown path the bridge must run its restoration: in `silent` mode
that means lifting the speech interception, so the reader speaks again. A crashed
or disconnected server must never leave the reader mute — this is the contract's
single most important invariant, and a bridge should arrange its interception so
that losing the bridge *itself* lifts it. (The NVDA bridge gets this from NVDA
holding extension-point handlers weakly: if the add-on dies, the filter drops
with it.)

## 7. Index semantics

Captured speech and braille each form an append-only log with **monotonically
increasing integer indices**.

- Ranges are **half-open**: `getSpeech`/`getBraille` return
  `[fromIndex, toIndex)`, i.e. `fromIndex` inclusive, `toIndex` exclusive, so
  `toIndex` is exactly the `sinceIndex` to pass next with no overlap or gap.
- `getNextSpeechIndex` returns the index the next captured item will take, so a
  test can note "now", act, then read only what its action produced.
- `waitForSpeech` blocks until a matching item appears or `timeout` seconds
  elapse; `found` says which. `afterIndex` restricts the match to items at or
  after that index.
- `waitForSpeechToFinish` blocks until speech settles or `timeout` elapses.
- All timeouts are in **seconds** (number; defaults live in `schema.json`).

## 8. Versioning policy

- Compatibility is decided by **exact `protocolVersion` equality** at `hello`
  (§3). There is no negotiation yet.
- Two forward-compatibility rules soften that: unknown **object fields** are
  ignored (§2), and unknown **capability strings** are ignored (§4).
- `protocolVersion` 1 is pre-release: it may be amended in place until an external
  (non-Python) bridge depends on it. After that, an incompatible change bumps the
  version and ships a new `specs/wire/vN/` directory.
