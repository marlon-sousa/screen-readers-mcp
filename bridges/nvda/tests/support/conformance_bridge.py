# nvdaMcpBridge tests -- a REAL bridge, started from outside pytest.
# Copyright (C) 2026 Marlon Brandao de Sousa. GPL-2. See COPYING.txt.
#
# ROLE: test scaffolding (a builder, not a port double -- hence tests/support/,
# per the root AGENTS.md). It is the headless bridge of
# tests/integration/test_socket_session_roundtrip.py and
# test_named_pipe_session_roundtrip.py -- a real BridgeServer, a real listener, a
# real Session, a FakeAdapterFactory in place of NVDA -- made STARTABLE AS A
# PROCESS so something other than pytest can drive it.
# USED BY: server/tests/conformance/ (spec 0013, deliverable 19), whose Go
# conformance job launches this script and then drives it with the real MCP
# server.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Every other test of the Go server drives a Go fake bridge, which
# encodes frames with the same generated binding the server decodes them with --
# so a bug IN THE BINDING is invisible there: both sides would be wrong together,
# in agreement. Only the real Python implementation of specs/wire/v1/ can catch
# that, and this is how the Go side reaches it. It is the successor to the
# same-bytes drift guarantee the two halves had while both were Python.
#
# The protocol with its driver is deliberately tiny, because a driver in another
# language has to implement it: start us with --transport, read ONE JSON line
# from stdout naming the endpoint we are listening on, then close our stdin to
# stop us. Nothing else is ever written to stdout.
#
# NVDA is not involved and is not needed: the fakes stand in for the reader, and
# what is under test is the WIRE, not NVDA's behaviour (that is entry 11).
