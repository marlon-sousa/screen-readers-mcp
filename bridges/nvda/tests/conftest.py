# Headless test harness for the bridge core (session B).
# Copyright (C) 2026 Marlon Brandao de Sousa. GPL-2. See COPYING.txt.
#
# The bridge domain imports NVDA nowhere, and the package ``__init__`` exposes
# GlobalPlugin lazily (so importing the package does not import NVDA either).
# The harness therefore only needs to: (1) sync the shared wire module in so
# ``from .. import protocol`` resolves to the exact shipped bytes; (2) put the
# ``globalPlugins`` directory on ``sys.path`` so ``import nvdaMcpBridge.*`` works.
# No NVDA stubs required.
#
# It also holds the fixtures that cut across test modules -- only those. A
# fixture used by one module lives in that module; one shared by siblings lives
# in a conftest.py beside them. See the root AGENTS.md ("Testing") for the layout rules
# and for when a fixture is the right tool at all.
