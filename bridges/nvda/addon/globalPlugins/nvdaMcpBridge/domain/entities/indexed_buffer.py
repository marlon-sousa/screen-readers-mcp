# nvdaMcpBridge domain -- IndexedBuffer: shared base for the capture buffers.
# Copyright (C) 2026 Marlon Brandao de Sousa. GPL-2. See COPYING.txt.
#
# ROLE: entity base -- index bookkeeping + thread safety + the wait loop.
# EXTENDED BY: entities/speech_buffer.py, entities/braille_buffer.py.
# DEPENDS ON: the Clock port (injected), nothing else.
#
# A stdlib-only port of the buffer half of NVDA's own ``NVDASpyLib``
# (``tests/system/libraries/SystemTestSpy/speechSpyGlobalPlugin.py``). Captures
# land in an append-only, index-addressed list guarded by an RLock, because the
# capture callback runs on NVDA's speech thread while the session thread reads.
#
# Index-based access -- "everything since index N", "wait for text after index
# N" -- is what makes assertions race-free: the agent bookmarks an index
# (``getNextSpeechIndex``), sends a gesture, then reads/waits from that bookmark,
# so background chatter that arrived earlier can never be mistaken for the
# response to its action.
#
# Index convention (kept identical to NVDASpyLib): a buffer starts with one
# empty sentinel entry at index 0, so ``[-1]`` is always valid and the first
# real capture lands at index 1. ``next_index()`` is the index the next capture
# will occupy; it is the bookmark an agent takes before an action.
