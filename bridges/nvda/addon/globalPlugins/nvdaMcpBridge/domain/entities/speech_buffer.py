# ROLE: entity. The bridge's central subject matter.
# FED BY: the SpeechSource port's implementation (the spy synth in silent mode,
#         the pre_speechQueued hook in live mode) calling append/notify_finished.
# READ BY: the Session controller, answering getSpeech / waitForSpeech / ...
# DEPENDS ON: the Clock port (injected via IndexedBuffer).

#: Neither mode has an exact "speech finished" signal (spec 0008 removed the spy
#: synth; silent mode suppresses at the speak() filter, so no synth ever runs),
#: so both treat speech as finished once this many seconds pass with no new
#: sequence -- NVDASpyLib's ``SPEECH_HAS_FINISHED_SECONDS``.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-08-03, and the number turns out not to matter: NVDA finishes
#: producing a keystroke's speech ~124 ms after the gesture, while an agent's
#: tool round trip is ~2.6 s. So by the time waitForSpeechToFinish arrives this
#: window has ALWAYS already expired, and the call returns from a stale
#: ``_last_time`` without waiting on anything. Shortening it buys nothing --
#: it was never being paid. See ROADMAP entry 11.9.
