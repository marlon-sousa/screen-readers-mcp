# nvdaMcpBridge adapters -- NvdaLiveSpeechSource: live-mode speech capture.
# Copyright (C) 2026 Marlon Brandao de Sousa. GPL-2. See COPYING.txt.
#
# ROLE: adapter. IMPLEMENTS the SpeechSource port for LIVE mode -- the real synth
#       keeps talking while we observe what it was asked to say.
# BUILT BY: adapters/nvda_adapter_factory.py when hello asks for live mode.
# COLLABORATORS: speech.extensions.pre_speechQueued -- the fully processed
#                sequence about to be synthesised (the pattern NVDA's own
#                _remoteClient uses). Live mode has no exact finish signal, so the
#                SpeechBuffer's elapsed-time heuristic decides "finished".
#
# suspend/resume are no-ops in live mode because nothing was ever suppressed.
#
# On pyright's ignore list (imports NVDA). NVDA holds handlers weakly, so this
# instance must outlive its registration -- the AdapterSet keeps it for the
# session; stop() unregisters at teardown.
