// screenreader-mcp domain -- the announce tool.
// Copyright (C) 2026 Marlon Brandao de Sousa. GPL-2. See COPYING.txt.
//
// ROLE: controller, one per tool. GATED on `announce`.
// USES: ports.Announcer, through ToolContext.Announcer().
// LISTED BY: registry.go.
//
// The only tool that addresses a HUMAN. Everything else here observes or drives
// a screen reader; this speaks to the person in front of it, through the
// reader's real synthesizer and UNDERNEATH whatever suppression the capture mode
// has in place -- which is the whole point, because the mode where the agent
// most needs to say something is the mode where the tester can hear nothing
// else.
//
// The description below carries the operational warning, and has to: in `silent`
// mode the tester can hear this announcement and then nothing further, cannot
// navigate, and cannot reply. Until entry 11.2 lands there is no reply channel
// at all, so an announcement in a silent session must TELL, never ASK, and
// should name the panic gesture as the way out. An agent that reads this tool as
// a chat channel will strand somebody.
