//
// ROLE: integration scenario, Windows only -- the real-transport tier for the
// pipe leaf, which is the transport the NVDA bridge ships listening on by
// default. Its non-Windows sibling is simply absent, which is what the build tag
// is for: the module still builds and unit-tests everywhere.
//
// This is the only place the pipe leaf and the pipe scan are exercised against a
// real namespace, and it is worth having separately from the TCP scenario
// because they fail differently: a pipe is a filesystem-shaped object with its
// own naming and its own liveness story.

// other error as "the connection died". Untranslated, every command slower than
// the 50ms poll -- every wait, and any gesture that makes the reader speak --
// failed with "bridge connection lost" over the transport the NVDA bridge ships
// listening on. Nothing caught it, because a fake bridge answers instantly and
// the in-memory transports report the deadline the way net does.
